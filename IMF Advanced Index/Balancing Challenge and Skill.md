# Balancing Challenge and Skill
Conceptually, getting into flow requires [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Balancing Challenge and Skill]]. It's the meta-meta-skill of creating the conditions of flow.

It's the most important condition because it's the direct result of the [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Four Factors of Flow]]. They are the Elements (or Levers) that dictate whether or not you're having a quality experience.

The most notable factor we can control here is [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Attention]]. Distractions, which are everywhere in modern society, are the bane of flow.
