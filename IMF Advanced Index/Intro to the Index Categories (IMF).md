### Customizing your Categories
It's easy, if you want to change 050 from Quotes to Habits it would go from this:

> 050s - [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Indexes/050 Quotes MOC|Quotes]]

to this:

> 050s - [[050 Habits MOC|Habits]]

Boom.

Then go to  [[050 Habits MOC|Habits]] and start working!
