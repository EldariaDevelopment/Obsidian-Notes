## (Example 1) MOC for 19 Concepts - As Daily Reminders
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/OODA Loop]], [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Levels of Magnification]], and [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Contextual Lenses]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Reps]], creating the conditions for [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Shadow Clone]]. 


[[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Lindy Effect]], along with [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Hormesis]] and [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Ying and Yang]], [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Synthesis]], [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/The Id]]. [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanded my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[remote-github/IMF Advanced Index/Charlie Munger's Mental Models]].
